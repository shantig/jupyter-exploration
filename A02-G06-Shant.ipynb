        "Image segmentation is the process of partitioning an image into multiple segments or regions, typically to identify objects or areas of interest. It's one of the most important steps in many computer vision applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Thresholding** is the simplest segmentation technique, converting grayscale images to binary by setting a threshold value.\n",
        "  - Global thresholding uses the same threshold for the entire image, which works well when objects and background have consistently different intensities.\n",
        "  - Adaptive thresholding adjusts the threshold based on local image characteristics.\n",
        "  - Otsu's method automatically determines the optimal threshold by maximizing the variance between foreground and background.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Edge-based segmentation** identifies boundaries between regions by detecting rapid changes in intensity or color.\n",
        "  - The Canny edge detector is particularly popular because it provides thin, continuous edges with good noise suppression.\n",
        "  - Watershed algorithms treat the image like a topographic map and find the boundaries between different \"watersheds.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "**Region-based** methods group pixels with similar characteristics. Region growing starts with seed points and expands regions by adding neighboring pixels that meet similarity criteria.\n",
        "  - Split-and-merge algorithms recursively divide the image into regions and then merge similar adjacent regions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Clustering** approaches treat each pixel as a point in feature space (based on color, texture, or other characteristics) and use clustering algorithms to group similar pixels.\n",
        "  - K-means clustering is simple and effective for many applications, while mean-shift clustering can automatically determine the number of clusters.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Modern deep learning** approaches to semantic segmentation can identify and label every pixel in an image with remarkable accuracy. These systems are trained on large datasets of ma\n"
